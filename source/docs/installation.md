## Installation

### System Requirements

To use Jigsaw, you need to have PHP (minimum version 8.2) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed on your machine. You'll also optionally need Node.js and NPM installed if you want to use [Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/vite) to compile your CSS and Javascript.

---

### 1. Create the Project Directory

First, create a new directory for your site:

```bash
mkdir my-site
```

### 2. Install Jigsaw via Composer

Next, navigate to your new project directory and install Jigsaw using Composer:

```bash
cd my-site
composer require tightenco/jigsaw
```

### 3. Initialize your Project

Finally, from your project directory, run Jigsaw's `init` command to scaffold the default directory structure:

```bash
vendor/bin/jigsaw init
```

Alternatively, get up and running quickly by using a [starter template](/docs/starter-templates), which starts you off with a fully-configured, professionally-designed site, ready for you to customize with your content. You can use one of Jigsaw's built-in templates for a blog or an open source documentation site, or [use a third-party template](/docs/starter-templates#installing-a-third-party-starter-template).

```bash
vendor/bin/jigsaw init blog
```

or

```bash
vendor/bin/jigsaw init docs
```

### Directory Structure

By default, Jigsaw gives you the following directory structure:

<div class="files">
    <div class="folder folder--open">source
        <div class="folder folder--open">_assets
            <div class="folder folder--open">css
                <div class="file">main.css</div>
            </div>
            <div class="folder folder--open">js
                <div class="file">main.js</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="folder folder--open">_layouts
            <div class="file">main.blade.php</div>
        </div>
        <div class="folder folder--open">assets
            <div class="folder folder--open">images
                <div class="file">jigsaw.png</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="file">index.blade.php</div>
    </div>
    <div class="folder">vendor</div>
    <div class="file">bootstrap.php</div>
    <div class="file">composer.json</div>
    <div class="file">composer.lock</div>
    <div class="file">config.php</div>
    <div class="file">config.production.php</div>
    <div class="file">package-lock.json</div>
    <div class="file">package.json</div>
    <div class="file">vite.config.js</div>
</div>

The `/source` directory contains the actual contents of your site. This is where all of your site's pages, CSS, Javascript, images, etc. will be kept.

At the root of the directory, Jigsaw provides a `config.php` file where you can specify configuration settings for your site, along with `vite.config.js` for settings related to compiling your assets.

Next, learn about [local development](/docs/local-development).
